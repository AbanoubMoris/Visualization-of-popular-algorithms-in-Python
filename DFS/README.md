Visualisation of DFS traversal using networkx library

Graph is first drawn from the weighted matrix input from the user. Recursive DFS is performed, resulting DFS forests are stored in
a stack. The stack is then used to mark the DFS traversed edges with a different colour(So, as to distinguish itself from the rest).
