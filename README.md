# Visualization-of-popular-algorithms-in-Python
The primary aim of the project will be to implement basic algorithms starting from Depth first search, Breadth first search to Advanced algorithms which are NP-Hard such as Travelling Salesman Problem, etc. The Mentees will be given the documentation of the algorithm and the task would be to use NetworkX library and visualize the output.

It includes:
