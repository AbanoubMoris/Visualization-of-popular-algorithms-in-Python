# Visualisation of A* Search using networkx library

### A* Search ###

A* search( pronounced as "A star") is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the that node which minimizes steps from the source(like in BFS) as well as approximate steps to the goal(like in greedy bfs). Hence, this algorithm is thorough and fast as it combines the strengths of both BFS and Greedy BFS.
A* algorithm is proven to give the optimal solution to a problem.
